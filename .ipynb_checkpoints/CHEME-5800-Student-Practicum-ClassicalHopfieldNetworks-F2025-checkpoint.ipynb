    "## Background: Classical Hopfield Networks\n",
    "A classical Hopfield network is a fully connected, undirected graph consisting of $N$ nodes, where each node has a binary state $s = \\pm 1$. Each node is connected to every other node, but not to itself. The connection weights between nodes $i$ and $j$, denoted $w_{ij} \\in \\mathbf{W}$, are determined using a **Hebbian learning rule**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Hebbian learning__\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * __Hebbian learning__, The [Hebbian learning rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebbian_theory), proposed by [Donald Hebb in 1949](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_O._Hebb), says that synaptic connections between neurons are strengthened when they activate (fire) simultaneously, forming the biological basis for __associative learning__. This \"fire together, wire together\" principle underpins unsupervised learning in neural networks, linking co-active nodes to enable pattern storage and recall.\n",
    "> * __Different?__ Unlike the previous examples of learning, e.g., logistic regression, or any of the online learning approaches that we looked at previously, the parameters (weights) in a [Hopfield network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopfield_network) are entirely specified by the memories we want to encode. Thus, we do not need to search for weights or learn them by experimenting with the world. Instead, we can directly compute the weights from the memories we want to encode.\n",
    "> * __Recurrent?__ a Hopfield network is a special type of [recurrent neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network) in which recurrence is used to settle into a stable pattern iteratively. It is considered recurrent because its units are symmetrically and recurrently connected, allowing the network to evolve toward an energy minimum over time.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> The Hebbian learning rule uses only local computations without explicit training iterations, providing a biological basis for memory encoding that operates without specialized hardware or extended optimization cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encoding memories into a Hopfield network\n",
    "Suppose we wish our network to memorize $K$-images, where each image is an $n\\times{n}$ collection of black and white pixels represented as a vector $\\mathbf{s}_{i}\\in\\left\\{-1,1\\right\\}^{n^2}$. We encode the image using the following rule: if the pixel is white, we set the memory value to `1`, and if the pixel is black, we set the memory value to `-1`. Then, the weights that encode these $K$-images are given by:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\mathbf{W} = \\frac{1}{K}\\cdot\\sum_{i=1}^{K}\\mathbf{s}_{i}\\otimes\\mathbf{s}_{i}^{\\top}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{s}_{i}$ denotes the state (pixels) of the image we want to memorize, and $\\otimes$ denotes the outer product. Thus, the weights are like an average of all of our memories!\n",
    "\n",
    "What about the bias term $b_{i}$? In this practicum, we will set the bias term to zero, i.e., $b_{i} = 0$ for all neurons $i$. This simplifies the network and focuses on the core dynamics of memory storage and retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __How big can $K$ be?__: The maximum theoretical storage limit $K_{\\text{max}}$ of a classical Hopfield network, using the standard Hebbian learning rule, is approximately $K_{max}\\sim{0.138}{N}$, where $N$ is the number of neurons in the network. Thus, the network can reliably store about 14% of its size in patterns before retrieval errors become significant due to interference between stored patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we've encoded $K$ images and want to retrieve one of them. This seems magical. How does it work? \n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm: Memory retrieval\n",
    "Each memory in a Hopfield network is encoded as a _local minimum_ of a global energy function. Thus, during memory retrieval, when we supply a random state vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}$, we will recover the _closest_ memory encoded in the network to where we start.\n",
    "The overall energy of the network is given by:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "E(\\mathbf{s}) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\sum_{ij}w_{ij}s_{i}s_{j} - \\sum_{i}b_{i}s_{i}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $w_{ij}\\in\\mathbf{W}$ are the weights of the network, and $b_{i}$ is a bias term. The bias term is used to control the activation of the neurons in the network. The bias term is usually set to zero, but it can be used to control the activation threshold of the neurons in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's outline some pseudocode for the memory retrieval algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Initialize__: Compute the weights $w_{ij}\\in\\mathbf{W}$ using the Hebbian learning rule. Initialize the network with a random state $\\mathbf{s}$.  Set $\\texttt{converged}\\gets\\texttt{false}$, the iteration counter $t\\gets{1}$, maximum iterations $\\texttt{maxiter} = 10N$ (where $N$ is the number of neurons), and patience parameter $\\texttt{patience}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Patience Parameter?** \n",
    "> \n",
    "> The patience parameter is used to determine how many consecutive identical states are required to declare convergence. A patience parameter is a practical heuristic that balances convergence detection with computational efficiency. Classical Hopfield networks can occasionally get stuck in short oscillation cycles (e.g., alternating between a few states). Requiring a fixed number of consecutive identical states ensures the network has truly converged to a stable attractor rather than just pausing briefly, or terminating prematurely. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Track__: Initialize a queue $\\texttt{S}$ to store the last $\\texttt{patience}$ state vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "While not $\\texttt{converged}$ __do__:\n",
    "1. Store the current state: $\\mathbf{s}_{\\text{old}} \\gets \\mathbf{s}$.\n",
    "2. **Asynchronous update**: Choose a random node $i$ and compute a new state $s_{i}^{\\prime}$ using the update rule: $s_{i}^{\\prime} \\leftarrow \\texttt{sign}\\left(\\sum_{j}w_{ij}s_{j}-b_{i}\\right)$, where $\\texttt{sign}(\\cdot)$ is the sign function and $b_{i}$ is a bias (threshold) parameter.\n",
    "3. Update the network state: $\\mathbf{s} \\leftarrow \\mathbf{s}^{\\prime}$ (only neuron $i$ changes).\n",
    "4. Add current state to history: $\\texttt{S}\\gets\\texttt{S} \\cup \\{\\mathbf{s}\\}$.\n",
    "5. **Check for convergence**: There are several criteria that we can use to stop the iteration and determine if the network has converged:\n",
    "   - **State stability**: If the state history $\\texttt{S}$ contains $\\texttt{patience}$ states and all states in the history are identical (Hamming distance = 0 between all consecutive pairs), then set $\\texttt{converged}\\gets\\texttt{true}$.\n",
    "   - **Memory retrieval**: Alternatively, if the current state $\\mathbf{s}$ exactly matches any stored memory pattern $\\mathbf{s}_k$ (Hamming distance = 0), then set $\\texttt{converged}\\gets\\texttt{true}$.\n",
    "   - **Energy true minimum**: If the energy $E(\\mathbf{s})$ equals or is lower than the __true minimum__, then set $\\texttt{converged}\\gets\\texttt{true}$. Notify that true minimum energy reached.\n",
    "   - __Max iterations__: If $t \\geq \\texttt{maxiter}$, set $\\texttt{converged}\\gets\\texttt{true}$. Notify that maximum iterations reached without convergence.\n",
    "6. If the length of the state history $\\texttt{S}$ queue exceeds $\\texttt{patience}$ length, remove the oldest state.\n",
    "7. Update iteration counter: $t \\leftarrow t + 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Hamming Distance**: The Hamming distance between two binary vectors $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ is defined as $H(\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{b}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathbb{I}[a_i \\neq b_i]$, where $\\mathbb{I}[\\cdot]$ is the indicator function. For convergence, we check if $H(\\mathbf{s}_{\\text{current}}, \\mathbf{s}_{\\text{previous}}) = 0$, meaning the states are identical.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "This practicum explores encoding and retrieving multiple binary patterns from classical Hopfield networks using Hebbian learning and energy-based optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Key Takeaways:__\n",
    "> \n",
    "> * **Hebbian learning for memory storage:** The network weights encode stored patterns through an outer product sum of memories, allowing direct computation of weights without iterative training. This biological learning mechanism enables unsupervised memory formation based on co-activation patterns.\n",
    "> * **Energy minimization for pattern recovery:** Memory retrieval operates by iteratively updating neuron states to minimize network energy, allowing the algorithm to recover stored patterns from corrupted or noisy initial conditions through local computations.\n",
    "> * **Storage capacity limits:** Classical Hopfield networks can reliably store approximately 14% of their neuron count in distinct patterns before interference between memories degrades retrieval performance. This fundamental capacity constraint reflects a trade-off between network size and memory density.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopfield networks demonstrate how local learning rules and energy functions can implement associative memory, providing a foundation for understanding recurrent neural network dynamics and constrained optimization in neural systems.\n",
